#Setup the openvpn client

copy your ovpn file to /root/ and in my case my file was named rasp4.ovpn under /root directory

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/openvpn@rasp4.service

then put:
[Unit]
Description=OpenVPN connection to %i
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/openvpn --config /root/%i.ovpn
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


now execute these commands:
sudo systemctl enable openvpn@rasp4
sudo systemctl start openvpn@rasp4
sudo systemctl status openvpn@rasp4
